# depot

A collection of mobile-focused lo-fi wireframe components built in Photoshop.

**What are these components based off?**

We have a consolidated [components inventory](https://docs.google.com/a/mobify.me/spreadsheets/d/18wIPqIzrAfK7s74S4NGokkbe8Qc9aGlSTSDqK19D2t4/edit?usp=sharing) that is constantly evolving, so check there first.

Also, check [Stencil](https://github.com/mobify/stencil) and [Vellum](https://github.com/mobify/vellum) as they contain commonly used patterns as well.
